Some simple airport procedures for FlightGear.

May be based on outdated procedures and waypoints, but that shouldn't really matter as these are for sim use only, not for real navigation.

To use, copy the file into the appropriate place in your scenery directory. For example, KLNK.procedures.xml should go under *Airport/K/L/N/*
